*** 1.2.2.2 **************************************************************************
Memory management improved
*** 1.2.2.1 **************************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
A new setting, <hide_longer_periods> was added to  <period_selector>. The default 
value is "true". If you set it to false, all predefined periods will allways be 
visible.

BUG FIX:
If the balloon was enabled for data set selector, the "compare to" list could show 
balloon with other data set's info.
*** 1.2.2.0 **************************************************************************
FEATURES ADDED:
*
A new setting <balloon_text> was added to <data_set_selector> group. Sometimes data set
title doesn't fit in the drop-down. If you set a value like {title} here, the roll-over
balloon will display full title so users could read it. You can also display {short} 
title and a {description} in this balloon.

*
A new setting, <disable_custom_cursors> was added. If you set it to true, custom hand
and resize arrow cursors will be disabled.

*
A new setting, <chart><events><show_date> was added. If you set it to false, the date
will not be displayed in the balloon (when you roll-over the event bullet)

*
When user clicks on a predefined period button, this JavaScript function is called:
amPeriodSelected(chart_id, type, count, id);

*
You can select predefined period with this JavaScript function:

flashMovie.selectPeriod(id);

id is the pid attribute: <period type="DD" count="10" pid="p1">10D</period>
Or order number of your period if you don't have pid attribute.

*
amClickedOn and amRolledOver JavaScript functions now return Array of objects 
containing data set title, short title, id and values of a clicked date:

amClickedOn(chart_id, date, period, data_object)

data_object's structure:

a) when data is not grouped into longer periods:
  
    values:
      volume:
        close: 21010110
    id: 0
    short: ES
    title: East Stock
  
b) when data is grouped into longer periods:
    values:
      volume:
        close: 16344710
        high: 21587410
        low: 16344710
        sum: 90934150
        open: 16509710
    id: 1
    short: ES
    title: East Stock
         
*
FIX:
In some cases event bullets were incorrectly placed above the graph.

*** 1.2.1.0 **************************************************************************
FEATURES ADDED:

A new setting, <update_on_release_only> was added to <scroller> settings group. If
you set it to true, the chart will not update while dragging or resizing scrollbar,
but do this only when you release mouse button. This is useful if you work with large
data sets and want to make your chart work faster. 

Stripping unnecessary symbols from your data
A new setting, <strip_symbols> was added to <csv> settings group. For example:
<data_sets>
   <data_set>
      <csv>
         <strip_symbols>",</strip_symbols>
         
Means the data parser will strip all " and , from your data before parsing.


The chart can be scrolled with mouse wheel. Note, the chart must have focus (click
once on the chart) in order this feature to work. This feature will not work if
wmode is set to transparent or opaque (in your HTML).
*** 1.2.0.0 **************************************************************************
FEATURES ADDED:

Columns can have rounded corners - a new setting for <graph> added: <corner_radius>
You can set corner radius in pixels or in percents. For example, 100%. (However
from usability side we don't recommend doing this).

The chart can display balloon with data set's title when user rolls-over
the legend item. This is comfortable when you have short data set name in the legend
and want to see the full name on roll-over. To enable this feature, set 
<chart><legend><show_balloon> to true. 

Possibility to set <bg_alpha> (background opacity) for period_selecto buttons.

An additional parameter is passed to  amGetZoom function - period. It tells which 
period is currently used (if the chart groupes data). So now the the chart calls
this function and passes: amGetZoom(chart_id, from, to, period).

amReturnParam function also returns the param name:
amReturnParam(chart_id, value, param);
*** 1.1.9.4 ***************************************************************************
FIX: The chart didn't work well if the year was less then 1000.
*** 1.1.9.3 ***************************************************************************
FIX: In case hour format was set to 12, clicking on a custom period input fields and
then clicking away resulted "check date format" message. 
FIX: Smoothed line when equal spacing is set to false was smoothed incorrectly
*** 1.1.9.2 ***************************************************************************
FIX: YTD predefined period could select plus one day
*** 1.1.9.1 ***************************************************************************
FIX: graph stacking problem with missing values fixed
*** 1.1.9.0 ***************************************************************************
NEW BULLETS for events: triangle_left, triangle_right, arrow_down and arrow_up.
The latter two can display text from <letter>;

NEW SETTINGS:
<column_width> for a <graph> - you can set a fixed width for your columns
<bullet_alpha> for a <graph> - you can set opacity of bullets
<bullet_color> for a <graph> - you can set the color of bullets

FIX: the date formats with years or years and months (no days) were parsed incorrectly.
FIX: If you hide the main dataset's graph, the comparing graphs didn't display tracing
bullet
FIX: when <connect> was set to false, <smoothed> set to true, and there was a data
point with gaps on both sides, the chart was drawn incorrectly
*** 1.1.8.0 ***************************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
Stock chart can support milliseconds now, check examples/milliseconds/ folder

FEATURE ADDED:
you can exclude the graph when calculating min and max values if you set 
<min_max>false</min_max> for this graph.

FIX: when all graphs of an axis are hidden, the grid lines and values of the axis
dissapear.
*** 1.1.7.2 ***************************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
You can synchronize right axis values with left axis. for example, if you set
<values>
  <y_right>
    <min>left*0.1</min> 

your right axis' min and max values will always be 10 times less then left axis' values.

FIX: If min or max value of the axis was set, and all the graphs of this axis were hidden,
the chart stoped working.

*** 1.1.7.1 ***************************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
New settings <scientific_min> and <scientific_max> added to the <number_format> group.
If absolute value of your number is equal or bigger then scientific_max or equal or less 
then scientific_min, this number will be formatted using scientific notation, for
example:

15000000000000000 -> 1.5e16
0.0000023 -> 2.3e-6

FEATURE ADDED:
scrollers' graph can now be "step" or "line". New setting <graph_type> was added to the
<scroller> group. The default type is "line". 

FIX: if start_on_axis was set to false and equal_spacing was set to true, the last
grid line wasn't displayed.

***************************************************************************************
1.1.7.0
<strict_min_max> setting was added. This setting goes to:
<charts><chart><values><y_left> (or <y_right>). If this is set to true, the axis will stay 
between Min and Max values even if there are graph points beyond those values. The parts
of the graph that do not fit will be cropped. If this is set to false, the Min and Max 
values will be extended to fit the graph. The default value is false.

<frequency> for scroller graph. If your data set has a lot of values the scroller might
significantly slow down the whole chart. (Provided you have some graph in the scroller). 
This new setting can help solve the problem. I.e. if you set 
<scroller><frequency>5</frequency></scroller>, the graph in the scroller will take only 
every 5th data point. Other values will be skipped.

<fade_others_to> setting was added. It goes to:
<charts><chart><legend>. When the user rolls-over a legend entry key, the other graphs 
will fade to this setting so that the rolled over graph would stand out from the rest. 
Recommended setting is 10-20. Most likely you should set <graphs_on_off> to false if 
you use this setting. 

New JavaScript function, setEvents(events, remove_old) was added. It allows adding events 
at a runtime. Use default event XML syntax: <events><event>....</event></events>. If 
you set the remove_old to true, the old events will be removed. Default value is "false".

FIXES:
When <equal_spacing> was set to false cursor was not always snaping to the nearest bullet.

Selected predefined period button lost selected color after the chart was resized or 
a data set for comparing was changed.

Now if you do not specify value for the events that are not assigned to any graph they 
will be displayed directly on axis.

"Parsing data" progress bar fixed.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.6.1
FIX: a problem with daylight saving fixed (appeared if you use <equal_spacing> set to 
false and your dates were set with hours).
***************************************************************************************
1.1.6.0
FEATURE ADDED: you can set custom date format for the period selector date input fields.
This can be done using this setting: <period_selector><date_format>. Note, you can't use 
"month" here - only "MM".

FEATURE ADDED: Custom background image can be loaded - the new setting, 
<background><file> was added. The file should be placed in the "path" folder.

FEATURE ADDED: JavaScript functions for getting and setting current status of a chart
If you call flashMovie.getStatus() function, the chart will return the current status
of a chart in a query string, for example: 

from=2008-01-01&to=2008-03-05&main=4&comparing=6,3

As you see, it returns the selected period, the id of the main data set and the ids of
data sets selected for comparing. 

To set this or some other status, you should call:

flashMovie.setStatus("from=2008-01-01&to=2008-03-05&main=4&comparing=6,3");

This is very comfortable when user navigates away from the page and you want 
to keep the same status when the user comes back.

FEATURE ADDED: new JavaScript functions for finding which data sets were selected
amSelectDataSet(chart_id, did) - called when main data set was changed
amCompareDataSet(chart_id, did) - called when data set for comparing was selected
amUncompareDataSet(chart_id, did) - called when comparing data set was unselected
***************************************************************************************
1.1.5.0
FEATURE ADDED: Vertical legend
A new setting <legend_position> was added. The default value is "top", the other 
available - "left" and "right". In case you use "left" or "right", you can control the
width of the legend with the <legend_width> setting. The default value is 150. Chec
vertical_legend example to see this in action.

FEATURE ADDED: The items in the legend can arranged in the reverse order. To do this,
set <reverse_order>true</reverse_order> in the chart's legend settings.

FEATURE ADDED: The graph can be hidden when the chart is initialized. This can be 
controled with the <graph><hidden> setting. The default value is "false".
***************************************************************************************
1.1.4.2
Changes in the settings:
New settings format for months and days:

 	  <months>
    	<jan>Jan</jan>
    	<feb>Feb</feb>
    	<mar>Mar</mar>
    	<apr>Apr</apr>
    	<may>May</may>
    	<jun>Jun</jun>
    	<jul>Jul</jul>
    	<aug>Aug</aug>
    	<sep>Sep</sep>
    	<oct>Oct</oct>
    	<nov>Nov</nov>

  	   <mon>Mon</mon>
  	   <tue>Tue</tue>
  	   <wed>Wed</wed>
  	   <thu>Thu</thu>
  	   <fri>Fri</fri>
  	   <sat>Sat</sat>
  	</weekdays>
    
The previous format will also work.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.4.1
FEATURE ADDED:
Stock chart can accept encrypted data and decrypt it. You can create your own encryption
algorythms. Check encrypted_data example and online documentation:
http://www.amcharts.com/docs/v.1/stock/how_to/make_the_chart_accept_encrypted_data

FIX: amClickedOn function is not called anymore if the chart was dragged.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.4.0
FEATURE ADDED:Y axis values can be formatted as duration. To do this, you have to
tell the duration unit of your data. For example, if your data represents seconds,
you have to set: <values><y_left><duration>ss</duration></y_left></values>
The units of the duration can be changed in the <strings><duration_units> section.

FIX: Events can be added with setSettings() JavaScript function.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.3.2
FIX: when data was missing, step line chart connected data points incorrectly
FIX: when <show_preloader> was set to false, the "processing data" text was still 
displayed while setting data with setData function   
***************************************************************************************
1.1.3.1 
FIX: If the data set, chart or graph was removed with JS function, and setSettings()
was called after, the objects reapeared (they were not removed from settings XML)

FIX: THe events were not hided if the graph was hidden.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.3.0

Stacking supported for "line" type graphs. You can stack one graph to another if you set
<stack_to>[gid]</stack_to> for the graph, where gid is the id of a graph to which you
want to stack the graph. Graphs can not be smoothed. The graph to which you are stacking
must be described above the graph which you are stacking.

Hide/show the graphs feature added.
You can show or hide the graphs by clicking on the legend keys. This feature is enabled
by default, if you want to disable it, set <graph_on_off>false</graph_on_off> in the
<chart><legend> settings. 

New JavaScript functions added:

flashMovie.removeDataSet(did);
flashMovie.removeChart(cid);
flashMovie.removeGraph(cid, gid);
flashMovie.showGraph(cid, gid);
flashMovie.hideGraph(cid, gid);

When you hide or show some graph the following functions are called from the flash: 

amGraphShow(chart_id, cid, gid);
amGraphHide(chart_id, cid, gid);
***************************************************************************************
1.1.2.4
FIX: if only one event was added directly in the settings file, this event wasn't 
displayed
FIX: step_no_risers graph type wasn't displayed
FIX: if the month name had "mm" letters inside it, these letters were replaced with
numbers
***************************************************************************************
1.1.2.3
FIX: javascript functions were not accepted if "no data" error occurred.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.2.2
FIX: if the "rebuild" param in setSettings(settings, rebuild) was set to false, the 
chart wasn't rebuilding after this param was set to true or the rebuild() function
was called.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.2.1
FIX: if the event date was formatted using new setting, the event date was incorrect.
***************************************************************************************
1.1.2.0

FEATURES ADDED:

** New settings, <bg_color> and <bg_alpha> for <y_left> and <y_right> of the <values> 
allows showing a color rectangle under y axis values. This might improve readability.

** New settings, <unit> and <unit_position> for <y_left> and <y_right> of the <values> 
allows showing units near y axis values. 

** a new group of settings:

<digits_after_decimal>
  <data></data>
  <percents></percents>
</digits_after_decimal>

was added in two places:

1) <charts><chart><values><y_left> and <charts><chart><values><y_right>. This allows 
controlling of the number of decimals for the axis values.

2) <charts><chart><graphs><graph><legend>. This allows controlling of the number of
decimals for the legend values.


** <events> was added to <date_formats>, so you could format how the date in the event
balloon should look like. 


** <connect> settng for the <graph> allows displaying  gaps in the line and step graphs
types, when data is missing. 


** <connect> setting is also added for the <scroller>


** JavaScript functions are cued now - previously you could call one JS function at a 
time and call another only after the chart finished the previous process. Now, you can
call several functions one after another, without waiting for the chart to finish 
doing something. The functions are cued and all of them will be executed.


** New JavaScript function amProcessCompleted(chart_id, process) added
This function is called after some process initialized by some JS function is finished.
For example, if you make the chart to reload data by calling reloadData function, after
the data is reloaded, the chart will call amProcessCompleted function and the "process"
parameter will be "reloadData" - the same as the function name you called.  


FIXES:

** The first data set was always selected as main, even the 
<main_drop_down selected="true"></main_drop_down> was set for some other data set.  


** events, hidden with javascript appeared again after scrolling.


** when the empty data was passed with setData(data) JS function, the chart didn't
display the "no data" message.

***************************************************************************************
1.1.1.0

FEATURES ADDED:

** from and to dates
You can set custom "from" and "to" dates now in:
<period_selector>
  ...
  <from></from>
  <to></to>

** dashed horizontal and vertical lines can be used with events

** border_alpha setting for events added

  
FIXES:
** The scrollbar graph dropped to 0 if the values were missing, now it connects the points 
as the main graph does.

** If settings were passed directly from HTML, context menu settings were ignored.

** resize_pointer_color was ignored.

** chart_id wasn't passed to JS functions after setSettings function was used. 

***************************************************************************************
1.1.0.0

FEATURES ADDED:

**Events in the settings file
Events can be added directly to the settings file, within <events></events> in the 
<data_set> section. This will allow you to have all the data in one file only.

**Horizontal and vertical lines (guides)
The events were extended so that the chart can display horizontal and vertical guides 
(barriers). Check the new structured_products example to see how this is done. 

**Base date of recalculation
Previously, when comparing the data sets, the values were recalculated from the 
selected period first date or from the first date of the data set. Now you can set any 
base date.  Value of a base date will be used as a base for recalculation. This might be
useful for structured financial products. You can set the base using <base_data> 
setting in the <comparing> settings. Check the structured_products example to see how
this is done. 

**Show / hide events with JavaScript
You can show/hide events with a new JS functions: flashMovie.showEvents(); and
flashMovie.hideEvents(); 

**12 or 24 hour format in the legend and axis
12 hour time format can be displayed in the legend and axis values. To do this, you
should set <hour_format>12</hour_format> in the date_formats settings. Hours in the 
data file must always be in 24 hour format. 

**Show comparing legend entries only 
You can make the legend to display entries of comparing data sets only and not to 
display the legend entry of a graph by setting <comparing_only> in the graphs's legend
settings. 

**Hide date in the legend when mouse is away from plot area
The date in the legend can be hidden when the mouse is not over the plot area. This 
might help you to avoid overlapping of date and legend entries, as the date takes more 
space when displaying period instead of single date. To hide the date, set:
<hide_date_on_period>true</hide_date_on_period> in the chart's legend settings. 

**Disabling interactivity
You can disable all the interactivity of a chart by setting 
<interactive>false</interactive> 

**Error messages
A new group of settings - <error_messages> was added. You can disable error messages,
set colors and opacity. 

**Keeping selected data sets after setSettings() function
Previously, after you use setSettings() JavaScript function, the data sets selected by
user were reset to the initial state. Now the chart keeps the selections. A new 
parameter to the setSettings function added, in order you don't want to keep the
selections: setSettings(settings, rebuild, reset_selected) 

BUG FIXES: 

flashMovie.print() and flashMovie.printAsBitmap() functions where not work properly in 
some cases.

JS functions amClickedOn(chart_id, date, period) and amRolledOver(chart_id, date, period)
were returning not full date and undefined period in some cases.

JS function on error, amError(chart_id, message) wasn't called when the error occurred.

***************************************************************************************

1.0.2.3
Bug fix: the first <letter> from <number_format> was ignored. Fixed.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.2.2
Bug fix: Events became visible only after scrolling or change of interval. Fixed.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.2.1

Feature added:
When comparing the graphs, you could set that the graph's values must be recalculated
to percents. With a new setting, <recalculate_from_start>, you can set that the first 
value of a graph would be used as "base" value for the recalculation. Previously only
the first value of a selected period could be used.  

Improvement: Now, if the data source doesn't have column which should be used as 
graph's <close> data source, the graph will not have legend entry in the legend. The
same is with comparing graphs - if the selected for comparing data set doesn't have
the column which must be used for comparing graph, This data set will not have entry
in the legend.

Bug fix: <digits_after_decimal><data> setting only added required number of zeros, 
not rounded the numbers when the data was grouped to a longer periods. 

Bug fix: If the chart had graphs both on left and right axes and also had events,
the events were displayed for two times instead of one.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.2.0

Feature added:
Smoothed lines feature added. Set <smoothed>true</smoothed> in graph's settings to 
make lines smooth.

"%" is added to Y axis values when charts are compared.

Bug fix: when <equal_spacing> was set to "false" and there were multiple graphs with
type "column", the columns were displaced incorrectly.

***************************************************************************************
1.0.1.1

Bug fixes:
When the <equal_spacing> was set to false, amGetZoom returned wrong "to" value.

JS functions: amRolledOver, amClickedOn, amRolledOverEvent and amClickedOnEvent
Used not to return chart_id variable. This is fixed now. Note, if you were using these 
functions before, you should add chart_id variable in front of the others, otherwise your
script will not work. 

Features added:

New javascript function setSettings(settings, rebuild) allows you to set 
multiple settings at once.

You can get chart settings using getSettings() JavaScript function.

When the chart finishes exporting it to the image, amReturnImageData(chart_id, data)
function is called.

***************************************************************************************

1.0.1.0

features added:

* graphs, also comparing graphs can be dashed
* new legend key type - "line"
* names of weekdays can be displayed in the legend
* scrollers selected graph fill color can be defined separately from the graph color
* uncompareAll() JS function added - deselects all data sets selected for comparing

bugs fixed:

* if user rolled over the event bullet many times, the chart slowed down
* date input field width was not adjusting if the dates used longer format
* "to" in the custom period field now shows the last available date of the period

***************************************************************************************
1.0.0.3
* bug fix: period selector "from" field didn't accept text color
* bug fix: x axis values didn't accept text color and size
***************************************************************************************
1.0.0.2
* {average} and {sum} in the legend now displayes average and sum of a selected period
* Fixed bug with showAll() JavaScript function
* setZoom() JavaScript function now also deselects the period button
* if no data was found in the data file, "no_data" error message is displayed
***************************************************************************************
1.0.0.1
* Fixed a bug with events
***************************************************************************************
