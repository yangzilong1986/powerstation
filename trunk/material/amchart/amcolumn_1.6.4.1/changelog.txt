*** CHANGE LOG *****************************************************************
*** 1.6.4.0 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED
Column corner radius 
Now columns can have rounded corners. Two different settings allow you specify
different corner radiuses for columns top and bottom. You can also set the 
roundness in percents:

<column>
    <corner_radius_top>100%</corner_radius_top>
    <corner_radius_bottom>8</corner_radius_bottom>

FEATURE ADDED
Roll-over color for the columns. Previously you could only set the roll-over
brightness. Now you can set a color to which the column will change when user 
rolls-over the column:

<column>
   <hover_color>#CC0000</hover_color>
   
FEATURE ADDED
amReturnParam function also returns the param name:
amReturnParam(chart_id, value, param);

*** 1.6.3.0 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
New settings <scientific_min> and <scientific_max> added. If absolute value of 
your number is equal or bigger then scientific_max or equal or less then 
scientific_min, this number will be formatted using scientific notation, for
example:

15000000000000000 -> 1.5e16
0.0000023 -> 2.3e-6
*** 1.6.2.2 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
a new setting, <js_enabled> was added. It allows disabling all javascript-html
communication. Id you set this to false, then the chart won't listen and won't
call any JavaScript functions. This will also disable the security warning
message when opening the chart from your hard drive or CD.
*** 1.6.2.1 ********************************************************************
FIX: if some values were missing the balloon was still displayed is column type
was set to "stacked"
*** 1.6.2.0 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:Y axis values can be formatted as duration. To do this, you have to
tell the duration unit of your data. For example, if your data represents seconds,
you have to set: <values><value><duration>ss</duration></value></values>
The units of the duration can be changed in the <strings> section.

FIX: If Stacked columns could broke if values were missing

FIX: you can call JS functions after amError function was called by the chart
*** 1.6.1.5 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED: Margins can be set in percents now
FIX: Minor animation fix when sequenced_grow was set to true
*** 1.6.1.4 ********************************************************************
FIX: The {description} was added to a wrong place in the balloon
*** 1.6.1.3 ********************************************************************
FIX: stacking of negative values could go wrong in some cases (only since 1.6.1.2) 
*** 1.6.1.2 ********************************************************************
FIX: The chart didn't accept new JS functions if error, such as no data occureed 
*** 1.6.1.1 ********************************************************************
FIX: url attribute wasn't working in v 1.6.1.0
*** 1.6.1.0 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED: PATTERNS
Columns can be filled with patterns now. Check examples/patterns/ example to see
how it is done. The pattern can be applied for the whole graph, for example:

<graph>
  ....
  <pattern>patterns/diagonal.swf</pattern>
  <pattern_color>#000000</pattern_color> 
  
In this case the legend key will also use this pattern. 

Or you can apply the pattern for the individual column, for example:

<value xid='2' pattern="patterns/vertical.swf" pattern_color="#000000">-1.8</value>

You can use swf, jpg, gif or png files for patterns. Some default patterns were
added in the amcolumn/patterns/ folder. Note, the patterns can slow down the 
chart performance, so it is not recommended to use them if you have a lot of 
columns.

FEATURE ADDED:  <data_labels_always_on> setting for <column> added. The default
is "false". If you set it to "true", the data labels will not be hidden if they 
don't fit inside the column or bar.

FEATURE ADDED: JavaScript functions are cued now - previously you could call one
JS function at a time and call another only after the chart finished the
previous process. Now, you can call several functions one after another, without
waiting for the chart to finish doing something. The functions are cued and all
of them will be executed.


FEATURE ADDED: New JavaScript function amProcessCompleted(chart_id, process) 
This function is called after some process initialized by some JS function is
finished. For example, if you make the chart to reload data by calling reloadData
function, after the data is reloaded, the chart will call amProcessCompleted 
function and the "process" parameter will be "reloadData" - the same as the 
function name you called. Check examples/javascript_control example to see this
in action.

NEW JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS ADDED:
amClickedOnBullet(chart_id, graph_index, value, series, url, description)
amRolledOverBullet(chart_id, graph_index, value, series, url, description)
Will help you to register clicks and rollovers on columns and bullets.

FIX: chart_id was lost after the use of setSettings JS function.

*** 1.6.0.1 ********************************************************************
Bug with logarithmic scale fixed

*** 1.6.0.0 ********************************************************************

FEATURE ADDED: NEW TYPE - 3D COLUMN

besides clustered, stacked and 100% stacked you can have 3D column now. The 
columns are positioned one behind another. 


FEATURE ADDED: SEQUENCED ANIMATION

if you set <column><sequenced_grow> to "true" the columns will grow one after
another, not all at the same time.


FEATURE ADDED: DARKEN/LIGHTEN COLUMNS ON ROLL-OVER

Using <column><hover_brightness> setting you can make your columns lighter or 
darker when the user roll-overs them. 


FEATURE ADDED: MORE SETTINGS FOR THE BALLOON

New balloon settings allows you to have balloon border and rounded corners:

   <balloon>
     <max_width></max_width>
     <corner_radius></corner_radius>
     <border_width></border_width>  
     <border_alpha></border_alpha>  
     <border_color></border_color>      
   </balloon>
   
FEATURE ADDED: AUTO-FITTING OF THE LEGEND and X AXIS VALUES

The legend now automatically adjusts bottom margin to fit to the flash object's 
area. If your X axis values are rotated, the legend position is adjusted not to
overlap the values. In order this to work, you have to leave <legend><y> setting
empty.


FEATURE ADDED: NEW BULLET TYPES

New bullet types are: square_outline and round_outline


FEATURE ADDED: POSSIBILITY TO SET ARRAY OF COLORS

Using <colors></colors> setting, you can set an array fo colors, which will
be used if the graph's color is not set.


FEATURE ADDED: CHANGE MULTIPLE SETTINGS WITH JAVASCRIPT

Using new function, flashMovie.setSettings(settings, rebuild) You can control
multiple settings.  It is recommended to use this new function even for one 
setting, instead of setParam() function. The "rebuild" option might be "true" 
or "false" (the default is "true"). If you set it to "false", then the settings
will not be applied until you call another new JS function: flashMovie.rebuild()
or pass another set of settings with the "rebuild" set to "true". 

A new function flashMovie.getSettings() will return the full settings 
XML by calling amReturnSettings(chart_id, settings) function. 


FEATURE ADDED: IMAGE DATA IS PASSED TO JAVASCRIPT

When exporting chart as an image, the chart passes image data to JavaScript 
function: amReturnImageData(chart_id, data) 


FEATURE ADDED: FONT COLOR AND SIZE OF A LABEL TEXT

<labels> Can accept  font color and font size HTML tags now, for example:
<text><![CDATA[Source: <font color="#CC0000" size="14">amCharts</font>]]></text>


CHANGE OF THE DEFAULT SETTINGS:
<context_menu><default_items><zoom> default value was changed to "false"


FIXES:
gradient_fill_colors attribute from the data file are now accepted.

When adding some settings using additional_chart_settings variable, you don't 
need to set all the <graph> or <label> settings anymore. When 
changing some <label> property using additional_chart_settings, in order to
identify <label>, the labels id (lid) must be added, for example: <label lid="0">



*** 1.5.2.0 ********************************************************************


New feature:
JavaScript function amError(chart_id, error_message) is called when one of the
known errors occurs.

Bug fix: value axis values were shifted to a wrong position when
chart type was "bar", values where displayed inside the chart and left margin 
was small. This is fixed now.



*** 1.5.1.0 ********************************************************************

New feature: the area between every second value axis' grid can be filled with
color. The color is defined at: <grid><value><fill_color>. Fill alpha can be
defined at <grid><value><fill_alpha>

Bug fix: When reloading settings with reloadSettings() function, if settings
file contained data, the data wasn't refreshed. This is fixed in this version.
