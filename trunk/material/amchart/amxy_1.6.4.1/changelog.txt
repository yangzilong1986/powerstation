*** CHANGE LOG *****************************************************************
*** 1.6.4.0 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED
New settings added to the <graph>:
<fill_color> - sets the fill color of the graph. Note, the fill will work
differently then in Line chart - it won't fill the area between graph and axis,
but rather fill the shape of the graph.
<fill_alpha>  - sets fill opacity.
<min_max> - you can tell the chart that it shouldn't include graphs values
when calculating min and max of the chart. 

The settings above allows you to simulate guides, draw colored areas on your 
chart. Check bulls_eye example to see this in action.

FEATURE ADDED
amReturnParam function also returns the param name:
amReturnParam(chart_id, value, param);
*** 1.6.3.2 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED: XY chart can display error bars now. Two new bullet types were
added: y_error and x_error. Error bars use "value" to show the error range. 
Unlike other bullets these bullets use y or x axis scale. Check error_bars
example from examples folder to see this in action. 

FIX: setZoom function could be called only once.
*** 1.6.3.1 ********************************************************************
FIX: the date formats with years or years and months (no days) were parsed 
incorrectly.
*** 1.6.3.0 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
New settings <scientific_min> and <scientific_max> added. If absolute value of 
your number is equal or bigger then scientific_max or equal or less then 
scientific_min, this number will be formatted using scientific notation, for
example:

15000000000000000 -> 1.5e16
0.0000023 -> 2.3e-6
*** 1.6.2.1 ********************************************************************
FIX: if x axis type was "date", and the min and max values of y axis were set,
the chart used to broke (this bug appeared in 1.6.2.0)
*** 1.6.2.0 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED: You can set min and max values of axis even the value type is 
"date"

FEATURE ADDED: You can make the zoom to be only vertical or horizontal: 
a new setting <zoom><disable_axis></disable_axis></zoom> was added. Set "x" to
disable horizontal and "y" to disable vertical zoom

FIX: a problem with daylight saving time was solved
*** 1.6.1.7 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED:
a new setting, <js_enabled> was added. It allows disabling all javascript-html
communication. Id you set this to false, then the chart won't listen and won't
call any JavaScript functions. This will also disable the security warning
message when opening the chart from your hard drive or CD.
*** 1.6.1.6 ********************************************************************
FIX: when the axis type was date, and only one value was set, the axis values
and the data point wasn't displayed.
*** 1.6.1.5 ********************************************************************
FIX export as image didn't work after the chart was zoomed-in
*** 1.6.1.4 ********************************************************************
FEATURE ADDED: Margins can be set in percents now
FIX: amGetZoom was called when resizing window (if the redraw was set to true)
FIX: if the redraw was set to true, the zoom area could flicker when zooming
after the window was resized.
*** 1.6.1.3 ********************************************************************
New settings <max_size> and <min_size> were added to the <bullets> setting group.
The graph settings <bullet_max_size> and <bullet_min_size> now inherits these
settings, so you don't need to set these values for each graph.

FIX: The size of a bubbles was calculated using max value of one graph, not the
max value of all graphs, as it should. 
FIX: value indicator plug-in was not working properly with logarithmic scale
axis.
*** 1.6.1.2 ********************************************************************
FIX: The chart didn't accept new JS functions if error, such as no data occureed
*** 1.6.1.1 ********************************************************************
FIX: url attribute wasn't working in v 1.6.1.0
*** 1.6.1.0 ********************************************************************

FEATURE ADDED: JavaScript functions are cued now - previously you could call one
JS function at a time and call another only after the chart finished the
previous process. Now, you can call several functions one after another, without
waiting for the chart to finish doing something. The functions are cued and all
of them will be executed.


FEATURE ADDED: New JavaScript function amProcessCompleted(chart_id, process) 
This function is called after some process initialized by some JS function is
finished. For example, if you make the chart to reload data by calling reloadData
function, after the data is reloaded, the chart will call amProcessCompleted 
function and the "process" parameter will be "reloadData" - the same as the 
function name you called. Check examples/javascript_control example to see this
in action.

NEW JAVASCRIPT FUNCTIONS ADDED:
amClickedOnBullet(chart_id, graph_index, value, x, y, url, description)
amRolledOverBullet(chart_id, graph_index, value, x, y, url, description)
Will help you to register clicks and rollovers on bullets.


FIX: chart_id was lost after the use of setSettings JS function.

*** 1.6.0.1 ********************************************************************

BUG FIX: problem with reversed axes fixed

*** 1.6.0.0 ********************************************************************

FEATURE ADDED: ZOOMING and SCROLLING

The chart has zoom and scroll (on both axes) now!
The scroller is controlled in the <zoom> section. Settings for this section:

  <zoom>
    <enabled></enabled>                         
    <max_factor></max_factor>                   
    <border_color></border_color>               
    <border_alpha></border_alpha>               
    <bg_color></bg_color>                       
    <bg_alpha></bg_alpha>
    <target></target>  
  </zoom>
  
Scrollers, which appear when the chart is zoomed, are controlled here:

  <scroller>
    <enabled></enabled>  
    <color></color>      
    <alpha></alpha>      
    <bg_color></bg_color>
    <bg_alpha></bg_alpha>
    <height></height>    
  </scroller>  

Atention! It is strongly not recommended to use dashed gridlines if the zoom is
turned on. This might cause your script run slowly or even stop the script.  

  
FEATURE ADDED: HELP
You can display help icon and text, like in line chart (you can explain for the
users how zooming works). Help settings:

  <help>                                   
    <button>                             
      <x></x>                            
      <y></y>                            
      <color></color>                    
      <alpha></alpha>                    
      <text_color></text_color>          
      <text_color_hover></text_color_hover>    
      <text_size></text_size>              
      <text></text>                                                         
    </button>    
    <balloon>                              
      <color></color>                      
      <alpha></alpha>                      
      <width></width>               
      <text_color></text_color>     
      <text_size></text_size>       
      <text><![CDATA[]]></text>
    </balloon>    
  </help>   
  
FEATURE ADDED: MORE SETTINGS FOR THE BALLOON

New balloon settings allows you to have balloon border and rounded corners:

   <balloon>
     <corner_radius></corner_radius>
     <border_width></border_width>  
     <border_alpha></border_alpha>  
     <border_color></border_color>      
   </balloon> 

FEATURE ADDED: ANIMATED BULLETS (BUBBLES)

You can animate bubbles using 3 different effects. Animation can be sequenced. 
This is controlled in a new group of settings:

  <bullets>
    <hover_brightness></hover_brightness>                  
    <grow_time></grow_time>                                
    <sequenced_grow></sequenced_grow>                        
    <grow_effect></grow_effect>                               
  </bullets>  

FEATURE ADDED: AUTO-FITTING OF THE LEGEND and X AXIS VALUES

The legend now automatically adjusts bottom margin to fit to the flash object's 
area. If your X axis values are rotated, the legend position is adjusted not to
overlap the values. In order this to work, you have to leave <legend><y> setting
empty.


FEATURE ADDED: NEW BULLET TYPES

New bullet types are: bubble (3D circle), square_outline, round_outline, x, 
romb, triangle_up, triangle_down


FEATURE ADDED: POSSIBILITY TO SET ARRAY OF COLORS

Using <colors></colors> setting, you can set an array fo colors, which will
be used if the graph's color is not set.


FEATURE ADDED: CHANGE MULTIPLE SETTINGS WITH JAVASCRIPT

Using new function, flashMovie.setSettings(settings, rebuild) You can control
multiple settings.  It is recommended to use this new function even for one 
setting, instead of setParam() function. The "rebuild" option might be "true" 
or "false" (the default is "true"). If you set it to "false", then the settings
will not be applied until you call another new JS function: flashMovie.rebuild()
or pass another set of settings with the "rebuild" set to "true". 

A new function flashMovie.getSettings() will return the full settings 
XML by calling amReturnSettings(chart_id, settings) function. 


FEATURE ADDED: IMAGE DATA IS PASSED TO JAVASCRIPT

When exporting chart as an image, the chart passes image data to JavaScript 
function: amReturnImageData(chart_id, data) 


FEATURE ADDED: FONT COLOR AND SIZE OF A LABEL TEXT

<labels> Can accept  font color and font size HTML tags now, for example:
<text><![CDATA[Source: <font color="#CC0000" size="14">amCharts</font>]]></text>

CHANGE OF THE DEFAULT SETTINGS:
<context_menu><default_items><zoom> default value was changed to "false"


FIXES:

When adding some settings using additional_chart_settings variable, you don't 
need to set all the <graph> or <label> settings anymore. When 
changing some <label> property using additional_chart_settings, in order to
identify <label>, the labels id (lid) must be added, for example: <label lid="0">



********************************************************************************
1.5.2.0

New features:

JavaScript function amError(error_message) is called when one of the known
errors occurs.



********************************************************************************
1.5.1.0

New feature: the area between every second axis grid can be filled with
color. The color is defined at: <grid><y><fill_color>. Fill alpha can be
defined at <grid><y><fill_alpha>

Bug fix: When reloading settings with reloadSettings() function, if settings
file contained data, the data wasn't refreshed. This is fixed in this version.
